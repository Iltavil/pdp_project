Algorithms
-we split the vertexes as equally as we can between the workers
-then for each vertex we check the neighbours, we see what colors they have and the current vertex takes the first free one

Synchronization
-for both cases when we work on a vertex we synchronize it and its neighbours, in ascending order and unlock in descending
 order, so we don't get deadlock
-moreover, for the regular implementation we use an AtomicInteger for the retVal
